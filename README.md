Welcome to the PennApps.com GitHub repo! To contribute to this Git repository:

  - Create a new branch named roughly after what you're implementing
  - Commit and push up your changes (to your branch)
  - Create a Pull Request to merge your branch into the main branch
  - Wait for someone else on Dev to merge your branch! (We'll get to it eventually.)

If you're new to web development, fear not. There are online tutorials and resources (including those of Gatsby below), though the most important resources will probably be:
  - Previous projects in the PennApps organization (check out the mentoring site!)
  - React tutorials
  - CIS 197's website https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis197/

To start development, just run `gatsby develop` in your terminal (in VSCode, press Control + \` to access the terminal). It will install dependencies, run the local development server, and hot-reload your page so that any changes saved in your editor are reflected in real time. (Might be a bit slow at first.)

Below is the default Gatsby welcome page.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd pennapps.com/
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

    Edit your page in `src/pages/index.js` to see your site update in real-time!

4. **For Dev heads only**

    To deploy, run `gatsby clean` followed by `npm run deploy` on the main branch. That's all.
